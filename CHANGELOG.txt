## 10/16: added sketchy chinese translator (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/translate)
##		added option to remove incorrect words
##		report those removed words at the end
##   	changed iterator to work with python3 (had been upset about changing dict size)

## 10/30: fixed bug if user removed last element in list
##		tried to use pygame, lots of issues
## 		decided to use python2 for this, since pygame is only running on that
##		this means I had to switch to "raw_input" instead of "input"
##		got basic pygame display working, still only writes out prompt

## 10/31: got pygame working decently
##		prints all needed things on string
##		to do: make "remove" button instead of typing "rm"
##				create text box to input text
##				create quit button
##				create try again button

## 11/1: added buttons from http://simonhl.dk/button-drawer-python-2-6/
##		check out http://www.pygame.org/wiki/TextWrap later for wrapping text
##		(e.g. wraptext.drawText(screen, "test", (255,255,255), background.get_rect(), font, aa=False, bkg=None))
##		now can input words, quit at end
##		remove button not working
##		cant get start screen to not be black

## 11/2: got everything (mostly) working for the basics on pygame app
## 		some sketchiness still with event checking
##		dont know how to put in a constant "quit/exit" button (even top x doesnt work)
##		can't find better translator
##		even non-words are found with this translator, don't know if there's a way around that
##		added colors and font

## 11/3: added a "submit" button at the beginning so user can enter words with or without pressing enter in between (stil doesnt work fully)
##		problems with detecting mouse clicks using event.get (switched to mouse.get_pressed)
##		really really couldnt get "submit" button to work
##			-problem combining key input with checking for button click

## 11/5: got "continue" and "add words" buttons working
##		found pretty good french english text dictionary: http://www.slideshare.net/RalphPilkington/english-french-dictionary
##		getting there, but still bugs to work out
##		problems if word is part of multiword definition for phrase,
##			or both english and french word (eg. chat/chat)
##		still have to fix "nonwords" list, couldnt get it working as returned tuple from dictMaker

## 11/7: changed from dictionary of single words to dict of lists, to allow for multiple translations for a single word
##		made sure it wasn't doing eng-eng instead of fr-eng (by taking itself as its translation eg. chat/chat)
##		fixed "count" bug by getting rid of enumeration in loop (still fixing)
##		incorporated Lexique for mophological parsing/accepting multiple verb forms
## 		broke up 'tester' into multiple functions

## 11/11: trying (unsuccessfully) to fix the problem of how to get the correct words removed
##		discovered that program had been looping without completing functinos, which mean that the word chosen was random each time
##		looping and reassignming word made it impossible to specify the correct word
##		more work needed

## 11/12: went through code, reworked everything to get rid of all the stupid fixes; think through how things are
##		SUPPOSED to be working, looked at what code was actually doing.
##		all loops working well now, fixed word-removal bugs, made code more effectively modular

## 11/13: tried to add in option to quit at any point
## 		unsuccessful so far, but added in the option after getting incorrect answer (since there were already buttons at that point)
##		problem is that it has to be at a point where pygame.event.get() is going, and can cause problems with other parts of the code

## 11/14: added option to do eng->fr OR fr->eng
##		added in "le" and "la" for nouns, since gender is important when learning vocabulary (used lexique)
##		when french->english, user can input either just *translated word* or "the *translated word"
##		otherwise, definite article require (and specified in prompt)

## 11/15: fixed bug that added le/la before pronouns and some other words that shouldn't have articles

## 11/17: fixed bugs for plural nouns, so that it didn't say things like "les chiens: dog"
##		now lets users input their own definitions for words not found in the dictionary

## 11/21: adds "l'" instead of le/la before vowels
## 		let user optionally write "to" before infinitive verbs
##		added "bonjour" and "salut" to list of words that dont get articles; havent decided how to deal with similar cases
## 		when "le/la/les" added to noun, instance of article by itself is removed from dictionary
##		now can have punctuation in entry strings (comma-separated, etc.) -- made new function for this: listMaker

## 11/24: user can now choose to add english OR french words
##		added prespecified lists as options as well (eg. food, animals, colors)
## 		made code even more modular
##		starting to maybe rethink the whole "adding articles to nouns" idea
##		I'd like to break up dictMaker, but it was causing problems when split up
## 		fixed up some aesthetics
##		fixed bug that ignored french word if it was a prefix of an english word in dictionary (eg. chocolat)

## 11/26: removed quit/restart buttons from wrong-answer screen; no justification for them being there
##		made dictMaker WAY faster by creating dictionaries for dict.txt and lexique, for O(1) searching instead of
##			iterating through both for each w
##		created list of words with multiple entries in lexique; WONT add articles to those words, since it's possible that
##			they have non-noun meanings for with articles won't make sense

## 11/27: worked on improving speed by making multiwordList into a dictionary, but instead
##			ended up making it 20x slower
##		made dictMaker a bit more modular

## 11/28: tried to figure out accents on pygame
##		decided to restart everything and use PyQt instead.
##		.........why do I do this to myself.

## 11/29: trying to move everything over to PyQt
##		struggling bigtime, but making progress
##		lots left to do before it will even run

## 11/30: one step forward ten steps back
##		still going at it though
##		can finally receive input and determine if it's correct/incorrect answer
##		currently just gives first word, doesn't iterate through

## 12/2: got PyQt mostly working
##		almost all of code switched over

## 12/3: added accent mark option
##		improved on quizlet: popup option with ALL accents
##		added logo
##		improved aesthetics

## 12/4: finalized change-over
##		added color
##		added new lists, made a separate window for choosing categories
##		fixed problem with inputting words in stages (had been only taking last input)

## 12/5: tried to bundle into full app, messed around in terminal,
##			dug myself deeper and deeper into a hole, culminating with
##			accidentally/notaccidentally uninstalling pyqt and miniconda
##			oops.

## 12/6: damage control, got everything up and running again.
##		still can't get app bundling to work

## 12/7: broke code up into multiple files
##		made it all better-practice-y
##		fixed problem with shift/tab keys and input

## 12/8: there's a demon in my computer, won't let me package app with pyinstaller
##		wouldnt work on trottier computers either, for python version reasons
##		fixed some definitions in dictionary
##		fixed bug when only nonWords are inputted

##	12/10: added statusbar to say how many more correct responses are needed
##		(so that user doesn't get confused why they're seeing word again)
##		now will accept contractions (eg. j'aime) -- only tests on word after '
##		fixed multiple issues/bugs with construction of english-french dictionary
##			when input language is english
##		added 's' to base word when the user asked the plural form of noun
##			sort of fixes the problem, but only works for nouns that pluralize that way
##		added feature to suggest lists based on user word input

##	12/11: tried to set focus on text box, failed
##		commented code
## 		added option for user to restart test with same words
##		added all files to GitHub
## 		full app now

## 12/16: added instructions window
##		now tells user explicitly to press enter after each word
##		fixed categories/dictionary (some words were missing)

## 12/18: clarified instructions



## THINGS TO ADD/FIX
##
## when user inputs english, gave every single verb form (ex. loger)
## "un" gives overwhelming amount of options for english->french (ex. "somebody")


## cursor pre-placed
## better searching
## add "hit enter" on input page too
## add "le" for french to english prompts
## "hockey" (and all same-translation words)
